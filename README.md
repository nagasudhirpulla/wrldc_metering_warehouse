## This project moves text files present in WRLDC metering systems to Database.

Postgresql is the database used to store the data.

A Data Adapter Plugin is hosted [here](https://github.com/nagasudhirpulla/electron_dashboard_metering_adapter) that can serve metering database data to [Electron Dashboard](https://github.com/nagasudhirpulla/electron_react_dashboard)
